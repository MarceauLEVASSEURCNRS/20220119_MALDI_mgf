# 20220119_MALDI_mgf

Description

This R script, built with the MALDIquant and MALDIquantForeign packages (https://github.com/sgibb/MALDIquant/), enables the pre-processing of .mzML data obtained from MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry analyses. This data format is obtained following a conversion of the manufacturer's files using MSConvert, a tool of the ProteoWizard software (https://proteowizard.sourceforge.io/). Its use enables the generation of a .mgf and .csv file that can be interpreted by MetGem software (https://github.com/metgem).
